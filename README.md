# Regression Analysis in R – Linear Modeling Foundations

This notebook introduces the statistical foundations and practical implementation of linear regression modeling in R. The content focuses on exploratory modeling, feature evaluation, diagnostic interpretation, and result communication within the context of a data science workflow.

## Objective

To develop and evaluate linear regression models using real-world data. The notebook emphasizes both interpretability and accuracy, with a focus on assessing assumptions, quantifying model fit, and preparing for scalable applications in analytics and predictive modeling.

## Technologies Used

- **R** – Core language for statistical modeling
- **Quarto** – Reproducible notebook format
- **Tidyverse** – Data manipulation and visualization
  - `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `broom`, `readr`

## Key Concepts Covered

### Model Specification

- Formulating a simple and multiple linear regression model using `lm()`
- Response transformation (e.g., `log(y)`) to address non-normality
- Categorical predictors and dummy encoding handled via R’s formula interface

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualizing relationships with scatterplots, boxplots, and `ggplot2` layering
- Checking for multicollinearity and variable distributions
- Using grouped summaries to inform model design

### Model Estimation and Interpretation

- Extracting and interpreting model coefficients, standard errors, and p-values
- Understanding residuals, fitted values, and leverage
- Using `summary()`, `glance()` (from `broom`) for compact model diagnostics

### Model Validation

- Comparing models using RMSE and adjusted R-squared
- Holdout evaluation using a test set and `predict()`
- Quantifying generalization error using `yardstick::rmse_vec()`

### Visualization and Communication

- Diagnostic plots for linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity
- Visual overlays of predictions and confidence intervals
- Communicating insights through clear plots and statistical context

## Applied Use Cases

The modeling structure demonstrated in this notebook applies to:

- Pricing models and cost estimation
- Clinical or customer outcome prediction
- Operational efficiency modeling (e.g., time, volume, throughput)
- Experimentation frameworks for A/B and causal inference

## Best Practices Emphasized

- Begin with EDA to inform model structure
- Use transformed responses only when justified and interpretable
- Validate model assumptions before deploying conclusions
- Prefer simpler models with strong explanatory power and generalization

## Getting Started

To execute the notebook:

1. Open `regression-STARTER.qmd` in RStudio.
2. Install required packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "yardstick"))
